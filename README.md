# MAT library code examples

Please also see the [library](https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/MAT).

To run the example code you will need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (bundled with npm) installed. 

From the command line:

```cli
git clone https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/mat-examples.git
```

Then change to the folder of the example you are interested in and:

```cli
npm install
```

to install the required dependencies.

And finally run:

```cli
webpack
```

and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

# StackBlitz

Most examples have a [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) that allows you to
quickly run the examples live in your browser. See each example's `README.md` for
its link.
